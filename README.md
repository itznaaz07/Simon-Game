# Simon-Game
<<<<<<< HEAD
I developed an interactive Simon Says Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸ§ This fun and engaging project tests players' memory skills by challenging them to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors..
 The game starts with a simple sequence, and as the player correctly repeats it, the sequence gets longer and more challenging. The game ends when the player fails to replicate the sequence correctly.
